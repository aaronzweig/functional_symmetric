# functional_symmetric

Experiments for "A Functional Perspective on Learning Symmetric Functions with Neural Networks" separating classes of measure-input functions.

Note: the "neuron" and "smooth_neuron" objectives are sampled randomly, and therefore some neurons will be linear when restricted to the input domain.
